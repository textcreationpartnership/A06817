            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>The Preface.</hi> Heere beginneth a little treatiſe or booke named <hi>Iohn Maundeuile</hi> Knight, borne in England in the Towne of S. <hi>Albone,</hi> and ſpeaketh of the wayes to Hieruſalem, to Inde, and to the great Caane, and alſo to <hi>Preſtor Iohns</hi> land, and to many other countries, and alſo of many meruailes that are in the holy land.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as the land ouer the Sea, that is to ſay, the holie land, that ſome call the land of Biheſt, among all other lands is moſt worthie and ſoueraigne, for it is bleſſed, hallowed and ſacred of the precious bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in the which land it liked him to take fleſh and bloud of the Virgin Marie, and to enuiron that land with his owne feete, and there he would do many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, preach and teach the faith and the law of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men, as vnto his children, and there he would ſuffer manie reproues and ſcornes for vs, and hee that was king of heauen and hell, of earth, of aire, of ſea, and land, and of all things that are contained in them, would alonely be called king of that land, when hee ſaid, <hi>Rex ſum Iudaeorum,</hi> I am King of the Iewes: For at that time it was the land of Iewes, and that land he choſe before all other lands, as the beſt and moſt worthie of vertues of all the world. And as the Philoſopher ſaith: <hi>Virtus rerum in medio conſiſtit,</hi> that is to ſay, the vertue of things is in the midſt: and in that land hee would lead his life, and
<pb facs="tcp:8336:3"/> ſuffer paſſion and death of the Iewes for vs, to ſaue and deliuer vs from the paines of hell, and from death without end, the which was ordained to vs for the ſinne of our father <hi>Adam,</hi> and our owne ſins alſo: for as for himſelfe he had none euill done nor deſerued, for he neuer thought ne did any euill, for he that was king of glory and of ioy might beſt in that place ſuffer death. For hee that will doe any thing that he will haue knowne openly, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it openly, in the middle place of a towne or of a Citie, ſo that it may be knowne to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the citie. So he that was king of glorie and of all the world would ſuffer death for vs at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, which is the midſt of the world, ſo that it might be knowne to all nations of the world, how deare he bought man, that hee made him with his hands to his owne likeneſſe, for the great loue that he had to vs: Ah deare God, what loue hee had to his ſubiects, when hee that had done no treſpaſſe would for his treſpaſſours ſuffer death: for a more worthie cattel he might not haue ſet for vs, then his owne bleſſed body, and his owne precious bloud the which he ſuffered for vs, right well ought men to loue, worſhip, dread and ſerue ſuch a Lord, &amp; praiſe ſuch an holy land that brought forth a Lord of ſuch fruite, through the which each man is ſaued, but if it be his owne default. This is that land prepared for an heritage to vs, and in that land would he die as ſeaſed, to leaue it to his children. For the which each good chriſtian man that may and hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſhould ſtrength him for to conquere our right heritage &amp; purchaſe, out of the euill peoples hands,
<pb facs="tcp:8336:3"/> for we are cleped chriſtian men of Chriſt our father, and if we be the right children of Chriſt we ought to challenge the heritage that our father left vs, &amp; take it out of ſtrange mens hands. But now Pride, Couetiſe, and Enuie, hath ſo inflamed the hearts of the Lords of the world, that they are more buſie to diſherite their neighbours, then to challenge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere their right heritage aforeſaid. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people that would put their bodies and their cattell for to conquere our heritage, they may not do it without lords: for aſſembling of the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a chiefe Lord, is as a flock of ſheepe without a ſhepheard, the which depart aſunder, and wot not whither they ſhall go. But would God the worldly Lords were at a good accord, &amp; with other of their common people, would take this holy voyage ouer the ſea, I truſt well that within a little time our right heritage before ſaid, ſhould be reconciled and put into the hands of the right heirs of Ieſu Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as it is long time that there was any generall paſſage ouer the ſea, &amp; that many men deſire to heare ſpeaking of the holy land, and haue thereof great ſolace and comfort.</p>
            <p>Wherefore yee ſhall heare by me <hi>Iohn Maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile</hi> Knight, which was borne in England, in the towne of Saint Albones, and paſſed the ſea in the yeare of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, a thouſand iii. C. on the day of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> and there remained long time, and went through many lands, &amp; many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, kingdomes &amp; Iles, and haue paſſed through Turky, and through Armony, the little &amp; the great, through Tartary, Perſia, Surry, Araby, Egypt
<pb facs="tcp:8336:4"/> the high and the low, through Libia, Chalde, and a great part of Ethiope, through Amazony, through Inde the leſſe &amp; the more, a great part, and through many other Iles which are about Inde, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people dwelleth of diuers lawes and ſhapes. Of the men of which lands &amp; Iles I ſhall ſpeake more plainly: and I ſhall declare part of the things what they are when time ſhall be, after it may beſt come to my minde, and ſpecially for them that will and are in purpoſe for to viſite the holy citie of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and the holy places that are thereabout, and I ſhall tell the way that they ſhall hold thether; for I haue many times paſſed and ridden it with good company, and with many Lords.</p>

               <p>A part of the crowne of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt wherwith he was crowned &amp; one of the nailes, &amp; the ſpeare head, and many other reliques are in Fraunce at Paris in the chappell of the kings, and the crowne lyeth in a veſſel of criſtall wel dight and richly, for the French king bought theſe reliques ſometime of the Iewes, to whom the Emperor had laid them to pledge for a great ſum of gold. And although men ſay that this Crowne was of thornes, ye ſhall vnderſtand that it was of Ioukes of the ſea, which be white and pricketh as ſharp as thornes, for
<pb facs="tcp:8336:7"/> I haue ſéene and beheld many times that at Paris, and that at Conſtantinople, for they were both of one, &amp; made of Ioukes of the Sea. But men haue departed it in two parts, of the which one part is at Paris, and the other part at Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, and I haue a point thereof that ſéemeth a white thorne, and that was giuen me for a great friendſhip: For there are many of them broken &amp; fallen into the veſſell, when they ſhew the crowne to great men or Lords that come thether. And yée ſhall vnderſtand that our Lord in that night that hée was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, hée was lead into a Garden, and there hée was examined ſharply, and there the Iewes crowned him with a Crowne of Abbeſpine branches that grew in the ſame Garden, and ſet it on his head ſo faſt, that the bloud ranne downe by many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his viſage, necke and ſhoulders, and therefore hath the Abbeſpine many vertues, for hée that beareth a braunch of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, no thunder, nor no manner of tempeſt may hurt him, nor the houſe that it is in may no euill ghoſt come, nor in no place where it is. And in that ſame garden ſaint <hi>Peter</hi> denyed our Lord thrice, and afterward was our Lord lead before the Biſhop &amp; Miniſters of the Law into another garden of <hi>Anne,</hi> and there hée was examined, ſcourged, and crowned oft with a ſwée Thorne, that men call Harbareus that grew in the ſame Garden, and that hath many vertues. And afterward he was lead to a garden of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and there he was crowned againe with Eglentine, &amp; after that hée was lead to a chamber of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> and there hée was crowned, and the Iewes ſet him in a chayre, and clad him in a mantell of purple. And then made they a crowne of Ioukes of the ſea, and there they knéeled to him &amp; ſcorned him ſaying. <hi>Aue rex Iudeorum.</hi> That is to ſay, haile king of Iewes. And of this crowne, halfe is at Paris, and the other halfe at Conſtantinople, the which our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt had on his head, when hée was nailed on the croſſe. And the ſpeares ſhaft hath the Emperour of Almaine, but the head which was put in his ſide is at Paris, they ſay, in the holy chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: and oft times ſaith the Emperour of Conſtantinople, that he hath the ſpeares head, &amp; I haue ſéene it, but it is greater then that at Paris.

And this Emperour did incloſe and wall the Church of the holy Sepulcher within the cittie, that before was far without the cittie, and hée would haue changed the name of Hieruſalem and called it Heliam, but that name laſted not long. And yée ſhall vnderſtand that the Saraſins doe great worſhip in that Temple, and they ſay that place is right holy, and when they goe therein they goe bare foote and knéele many times downe.

They ſhould bée ſimple, méeke and ſoft, and doe their almes as Ieſus Chriſt did, in whom they beléeue, and hée ſayd they are ſo couetouſe, that for a little money they ſell their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their ſiſters, and their wiues, and one taketh another mans wife and none kéepeth his promiſe to another, therefore ſaid he, for their ſins God hath giuen theſe lands to our hands, and not through our ſtrength, but all for your ſins.

And then I aſked him how that hee knew the ſtate of Chriſtians in that manner, and hée ſayd that he knew well both of Lords and commons, by his meſſengers which hée ſent through all the countries as it were marchants with precious ſtones and other marchandiſe to know the manner of euery country.

But men may aſſay them well in this manner: firſt, cut them on precious ſtones, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyres or vpon Chriſtall, and then take a ſtone that is called Adamand, and lay a néedle béefore that Adamand, and if the Diamond bée good and vertuous, the Adamand draweth not the néedle to it, whiles the Diamond is there. And this is the proofe that they make beyond the ſea. But it chancheth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that the good Diamond looſeth it vertue through him that beareth it, and therefore it is néedefull for to make it to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his vertue againe, or elſe it is little of value.</p>

In the land of Iude are more then fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Iles that are inhabited (beſide diuers that are vninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and in each one of thoſe is great plentie of Citties, and much people: for men of Inde are of that condition that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they paſſe not out of their land, for they dwell vnder the Planet <hi>Saturne,</hi> and that Planet maketh his courſe by the xij. Signes in thirtie yéere, and the Moone paſſeth through the xij.

But in our countrie it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for wée are in a Climate that is of the Moone, and of light ſtirring, and that is the Planets of way, and therefore it giueth vs will to much moouing and ſtirring, and to goe into diuers Countries of the world, for it goeth about the world more lightly then any other Planet doth. Alſo men paſſe through Inde to many countries by ſea. And then they come to the Ile of Hermes, where Marchaunts of Venice and of Gene and of other diuers parts of Chriſtendome come to buy their marchandiſe, but it is ſo warme there in that Ile that mens members hang downe to their ſhanks for the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing of the body.

               <p>And there are ſome Chriſtians that ſay ſome Beaſtes are better for to méete then other, for Hares, Swine, and other beaſts are ill to méete firſt as they ſay. In this Ile of Cana is many wilde beaſts, and rats in that country are as great as hounds here, and they take them with maſtiſes, for cats may not take them. From thence men come to a Cittie that is called Sarchis, and it is a faire and good cittie, and there dwell many Chriſtians of Gods faith, and there bée men of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Fom thence men come to the Land of Lombe, and in that land groweth pepper in a forreſt that is called Tomber and it groweth in none other place more in all the world then in that forreſt, and that forreſt is fiftie dayes iourney, &amp; there by the land of Lombe is the citie of Polomes, and vnder that cittie is a hill that men call Polombe, and thereof taketh the cittie his name.</p>

And alſo at each houre of the day it changeth his ſauour diuerſly, and who ſo drinketh thrice in the day of that well, hée is made whole of all manner ſicknes that hée hath, I haue ſometime dronke of that well, and mée thinketh yet that I fare the better, ſome call it the Well of
<pb facs="tcp:8336:47"/> youth, for they that drinke thereof ſéeme to be young alway, &amp; liue without much ſickneſſe, and they ſay this well commmeth from Paradiſe <hi>terreſtre,</hi> for it is ſo vertuous, and in this land groweth ginger, and thether come many rich marchants for ſpices. In this country men worſhip an Oxe for his great ſimpleneſſe and méekeneſſe, &amp; the profit that is in him, for they make the Oxe to trauaile vi. or vij. yéere, and then men do eate him. And the king of that land hath euermore one Oxe with him, and hée that kéepeth him euery day taketh his fées for the kéeping. And alſo euery day hée gathereth his vrine, and his doung in a veſſell of gold, and beareth it to the prelate that they call <hi>Archt porta papaton,</hi> and the prelate beareth it to the king, and maketh therupon a great bleſſing, and then the king putteth his hand therin, and they call it gaule, and he annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his front, and his breaſt therewith, and they doe it great worſhip, and ſay hée ſhall bée fulfilled with the vertue of the Oxe before ſaid, and that hée is hallowed through vertue of thoſe holy things as they ſay. And when the king hath thus done, than other Lords doe it, and after them other men after their degrée if they may haue any of the remnant.</p>
               <p>In this country their Idols are halfe man and halfe Oxe, as the figure in the ſecond leafe before is ſhewed, and out of theſe Idols the wicked Ghoſt ſpeaketh vnto them, and giueth them anſwere of what thing that they aſke him, and before theſe Idols they many times ſlay their children, and ſprinkle the bloud on the Idols, and ſo make ſacrifice. And if any man dye in that country, they burne them in token of penance, that hée ſhould ſuffer no penance if hée were laid in the earth by eating of wormes. And if his wife haue not children, then they burne her with him, and they ſay that it is good reaſon that ſhée kéepe him company in the other world as ſhée did in this, and if ſhée haue children ſhée may liue with them, if ſhée will, and if the wife die before, ſhée ſhall bée burnt and her huſband alſo if he will. In this country groweth good wine, and women drinck wine and men none, and women ſhaue their heads and not men.</p>

Who ſo goeth from Cathay to Inde the high and the low, hée ſhall goe through a kingdome that men call Cadiſſen, and it is a great land, there groweth a manner of fruit as it were gourdes, and when it is ripe, men cut it a ſunder, and they finde therein a beaſt as it were of fleſh, and bone, &amp; blood, as it were a little lambe without wooll, and men eate the beaſt and fruit alſo, and ſure it ſéemeth very ſtrange.

Here ſome men might aſke, if there be a ſea on one ſide, why goe they not out there, for thereto aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere I that although it be called a ſea, it is not a ſea, but a poole ſtanding among hils, and it is the greateſt Poole of all the world, and though they go ouer that poole, yet they wot not where to ariue, for they can no ſpeach but their owne. And yée ſhall vnderſtand that theſe Iewes which dwel among the hils haue no law among them, and yet they pay tribute for their land to the Quéene of Armony: and ſometime it is ſo that ſome of theſe Iewes goe ouer the hils, but many may not paſſe there together for the hils are ſo great and high. Neuertheleſſe, men ſay in that country thereby that in the time of Antichriſt they ſhall doe much harme to chriſtian men, and therefore all the Iewes that dwell in diuers parts of the world learne for to ſpeake Ebrew, for they hope that theſe Iewes that dwell
<pb facs="tcp:8336:67"/> among the hils aforeſaid ſhal come out of the hils and ſpeake all Ebrew and nought elſe, and then ſhall theſe Iewes ſpeake Ebrew to them and lead them into Chriſtendome for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſtian men. For theſe Iewes ſay they know by their Propheſies that thoſe Iewes that are among thoſe hilles of Caſpy ſhall come out, and chriſtian men ſhall bée in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection as they be vnder Chriſtian men now.
